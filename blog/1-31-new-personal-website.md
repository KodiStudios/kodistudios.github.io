## Tonivo App

https://kodistudios.com/docs/tonivo

- 🐣 Enabled Tonivo App on Lower Windows Versions
  Originally, Tonivo App was able to run
  only on most recent Windows.
  However, it would be nice to support to more
  Windows versions, including some older ones.
  This really increases users who can download and use
  Tonivo App. Now, all of the following versions are supported:
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10
  - Windows 8
  - Windows 7

# Next Effort
