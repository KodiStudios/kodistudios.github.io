# Intro

It turns out that OneDrive is rather slow to display images through shared URLs.
Thus, I ventured onto journey to find alternatives to OneDrive.

# Accomplishments

## Images Research

- 🖼️ Cloudify  
  After real world testing of OneDrive as image provider
  through URLs, it turned out that OneDrive is extremely slow.
  Like it takes about 5 seconds to load a single image.
  Started to explore other providers. One promising solution
  is Cloudify.
  However, during my research, I ran out of VsCode
  Copilot Credits 😅
  Which just shows how important AI utilities have
  become nowadays.
